1. You should replace the working directories with their equivalent on your machine
2. To download the data: download files.py -> will use chromedriver too
3. To clean the data: Merge_files.py

4. Mean reversion strategy: strat_reversal.py (the same files, but followed by _2017 are for the out-of-sample testing)

5. Second Strategy: Run the code Backtesting.py that backtests the strategy from 2014 to 2017 on EURAUD. The data provided in the Grouped_Data folder is already cleaned by the download_files.py and Group_by_Time.py codes.
